## Study data

For each participant two files exist:

* `Pxx_2022-xx-xx.csv`: contains raw tracking data for analysis of turning points, and overall tracking quality
* `Pxx_2022-xx-xx.json` : contains results for each trial, especially:
  * Expected and reported result layers and result numbers
  * Layer configuration used in the task
  * Start of the Trial: `StartDate`
  * End of Interaction: `EndInteractionDate`
  * Time when layer result and number were reported: `CommitResultDate`
* __Remarks__:
  * Datasets starting with `P00` refer to test runs before the final study for testing/finetuning study setup and procedure

## Notebooks

* `study_convertMissingColumns`: used to reconstruct the empty columns for layer numbers in the first trials (one-time fix)
* `convert_results`:
  * merges separate results for each proband in one large result file (json and data) - do this, when new data is added, as `export/data/data_experiment.csv` is not in version control (too large)
  * computes additional columns
  * computes cleaned up interaction phase and saves times and markers to associated columns in results / data
* `study_general`: first raw extraction of results on separate data files
* `study_results`:
  * load data either from `export/data/results_experiment_cleanedDuration.csv` (cleaned-up interaction times) or from `export/data/results_experiment.csv`
  * computes statistics for duration and
  * correctness of results
* `study_turning-points`:
  * computes turning points
  * compute cleaned up interaction data by removing leading and trailing idle times
* `study_frametimes`: compute frametimes from `data_all.csv`

## update results

in case of new results added, execute the following steps in the given order:

1. add missing `;` at the end of the header in the newly added `.csv` files
2. run `convert_results.ipynb` to update the result including the computed values
3. run the follwing nb files in arbitrary order:
   * `study_results.ipynb`
   * `study_frametimes.ipynb`
   * `study_inLayerDurations.ipynb`
   * `study_border-durations.ipynb`
   * `study_turning-points.ipynb`

afterwards, the exported csv -files can be re-imported to spss to regenerate the statistics results.
