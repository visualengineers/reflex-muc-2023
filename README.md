## Study data

* Study data was pregenerated for 50 participants
* Generated data can be found in `data/trial_data`
* each participant is associated with a data file: `data_{ParticipantId}.json`

* each block is associated with a specific feedback `condition` and consists of a number of trials
* blocks with a negative index are training blocks (excluded from analysis)
* each trial consists of a list of `points` that are used to draw the scatterplot
* each trial has an associated `index` (within the block), the `result number` and `layer` and a `global trial index` (for the participant over the whole experiment)
* each point has a screen `position`, a `layer`, in which it is displayed and a `category` that defines the color

## Study results

For each participant two files exist:

* `Pxx_2022-xx-xx.csv`: contains raw tracking data for analysis of turning points, and overall tracking quality
* `Pxx_2022-xx-xx.json` : contains results for each trial, especially:
  * Expected and reported result layers and result numbers
  * Layer configuration used in the task
  * Start of the Trial: `StartDate`
  * End of Interaction: `EndInteractionDate`
  * Time when layer result and number were reported: `CommitResultDate`
* __Remarks__:
  * Datasets starting with `P00` refer to test runs before the final study for testing/finetuning study setup and procedure

## Notebooks

* `preprocess_convertMissingColumns`: used to reconstruct the empty columns for layer numbers in the first trials (one-time fix)
* `preprocess_convert_results`:
  * merges separate results for each proband in one large result file (json and data) - do this, when new data is added, as `export/data/data_experiment.csv` is not in version control (too large)
  * computes additional columns
  * computes cleaned up interaction phase and saves times and markers to associated columns in results / data
* `preprocess_fix_p19`: merge datasets of participant 19 (restart of application after Block 1) + switches reported number and layer
* `preprocess_export_SPSS`: transformation of Datset and export for direct analysis in SPSS
* `study_questionnaire-general`: first raw extraction of results on separate data files
* `study_duration`:
  * load data either from `export/data/results_experiment_cleanedDuration.csv` (cleaned-up interaction times) or from `export/data/results_experiment.csv`
  * computes statistics for duration and
  * correctness of results
  * mean difference between reported and expected layer result
* `study_outcome`: computes statistics regarding success rate of reported layers and numbers
* `study_turning-points`, `study_peaks`:
  * computes turning points
  * compute cleaned up interaction data by removing leading and trailing idle times
* `study_frametimes`: compute frametimes from `data_all.csv`
* `study_layerChanges`: statistics for number of layer changes during the trial
* `study_inLayerDurations`: statistics for for mean durations of holding a layer during the trial
* `study_validity`: descriptive statistics and plots for general study procedure
* `study_regressio_plots`: regression analysis and plots for devleopment of mean trial duration ober the blocks in respect to the conditions

## update results

in case of new results added, execute the following steps in the given order:

1. add missing `;` at the end of the header in the newly added `.csv` files
2. run `convert_results.ipynb` to update the result including the computed values
3. run the follwing nb files in arbitrary order:
   * `study_results.ipynb`
   * `study_frametimes.ipynb`
   * `study_inLayerDurations.ipynb`
   * `study_border-durations.ipynb`
   * `study_turning-points.ipynb`

afterwards, the exported csv -files can be re-imported to spss to regenerate the statistics results.
